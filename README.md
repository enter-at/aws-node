import {APIGatewayProxyEvent, APIGatewayProxyResult} from 'aws-lambda';

const validationSchema = object({
    email: string().email().required()
});

export class GetAccountDataAdapter {

    contructor(private service: IService) {}

    @APIGatewayProxyHandler()
    public async handle(event: APIGatewayProxyEvent): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> {
        try {
            const payload = await this.readPayload(event.queryStringParameters);
            return ok(await this.service.fetch(payload));
        } catch (err) {
            if (err instanceof ResourceNotFoundError) {
                return notFound(err.message);
            }
            throw err;
        }
    }

    private async validatePayload<T>(parameters: any): Promise<T> {
        try {
            return await validationSchema.validateAsync(parameters, {abortEarly: false});
        } catch (err) {
            throw new BadRequestError(err.details.map((detail: any) => detail.message));
